# Hoeffding's inequality provides an upper bound on the probability of the empirical mean, v, of a sample 
# of N independent random variables deviating from its expected value, m, by more than some amount, eps.  
# In the case of Bernoulli random variables, it can be mathematically stated as follows:
# 
# P[|v - m| > eps] <= 2e^(-2(eps^2)N)
# 
# A larger sample size, N, tightens the bound whereas a stricter restriction, eps, loosens it.
#
# This simulation illustrates Hoeffding's bound by sampling from the distribution of the fraction of heads observed
# vs tails (v) when tossing a fair coin.  1000 samples are produced by flipping 1000 coins a designated number of times.
# Focus is placed on three of these coins; the first coin flipped (c_1), a randomly chosen coin (c_rand), and the coin
# with the minimum frequency of heads (c_min).  Distributions of v for each of these coins are generated by repeating 
# the experiment a designated number of times.  Both sides of Hoeffding's inequality are then evaluated across various 
# values of epsilon and plotted for each of the three distributions.  As expected, Hoeffding's bound holds for 
# v_1 and v_rand as their values represent a random sampling.  Hoeffding's bound does not hold for v_min as its 
# distribution was generated by deliberately choosing a particular coin during each trial.
