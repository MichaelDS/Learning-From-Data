############### LINEAR REGRESSION & CLASSIFICATION ###############
#
# Supervised learning via linear regression is designed for use with real-valued output, however, it can also provide 
# good results when used for classification.  An advantage of linear regression is the simplicity of the algorithm for 
# computing the final hypothesis.  This "one-step learning" is carried out as follows:
#
# Given the N x n data matrix, X, and the N x 1 output matrix, y, compute the weight vector
#
# w = pseudoInverse(X) x y = (t(X) x X)^-1 x t(X) x y
#
# This weight vector minimizes the error measure (sum of squares); thus, it computes the final hypothesis.   
# This weight vector can also be used as an initial weight vector for a learning algorithm designed for 
# classification, such as PLA.  This provides the benefit of the more precise final hypothesis provided by PLA
# along with a lower computation time than would have been required to run the PLA algorithm alone; this is 
# because regression provides PLA with a good initial approximation, cheaply taking care of much of the searching 
# that the PLA algorithm would otherwise have done.
#
# This simulation implements implements linear regression uses it for classification.  A target function f and a 
# dataset D in d = 2 are created.  X = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] with uniform probability of picking each x in X.  Each run 
# chooses a random line in the plane as the target function by taking the line passing through two random, uniformly 
# distributed points in [-1, 1] x [-1, 1], where one side of the line maps to +1 and the other maps to -1. The inputs, 
# x_n, of the data set are chosen as random points (uniformly in X), and the target function is evaluated on each x_n 
# to get the corresponding output, y_n. Regression is then be used to learn from this data and the final hypothesis is 
# tested against an independently generated data set.  This can be done  with or without any additional adjustment to 
# the final hypothesis by PLA.


## Function for generating the data and, if specified, a target function
data.generate <- function(n = 10, ext = 1, generateTarget = FALSE){ 
  # Generate the points
  x1 <- runif(n, -ext, ext)
  x2 <- runif(n, -ext, ext)
  if (!generateTarget)
    return(data.frame(x1, x2))
  
  # Draw a random line in the area (target function)
  point <- runif(2, -ext, ext)
  point2 <- runif(2, -ext, ext)
  slope <- (point2[2] - point[2]) / (point2[1] - point[1])
  intercept <- point[2] - slope * point[1]
  
  # Set up a factor for point classification
  y <- as.numeric(x1 * slope + intercept > x2) * 2 - 1
  
  # Return the values in a list
  data <- data.frame(x1,x2,y)
  return(list(data = data,slope = slope, intercept = intercept))
}


## Uses regression to approximate target functions on simulated data
## If specified, the resulting regression model is used as a starting point for the perceptron(pocket) learning algorithm in order to further improve the approximation
## Returns a list containing the average of the in-sample and out-of-sample error measures of the final hypotheses obtained across numTrials
## Plots the target function and final hypothesis of the last trial against training data and against test data
