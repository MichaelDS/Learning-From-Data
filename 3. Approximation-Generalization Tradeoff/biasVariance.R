############### BIAS & VARIANCE ###############
#
# Bias-variance analysis is a method for quantifying approximation-generalization tradeoff that is particularly 
# well suited for analyzing the approximation of real-values targets.  It decomposes E_out as follows: 
#
# The expected value of of E_out with respect to all possible training sets of size N, 
# D = (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (x_N, y_N), where the x_n's are picked independently from X, is the sum of the model's 
# bias and variance; Expectation_D[E_out] = bias + variance.  Bias is a measure of the best approximation error that 
# the model can achieve; it does not depend on D and is determined by the variance of the noise (note the distinction 
# between this variance and the variance of the model's performance, which is the subject of bias-variance analysis).
# The variance of the model's performance is a measure of how much the model's approximation varies from it's best
# performance; this measure does depend on D.  In order to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff, one should always
# match the model complexity to the data resources, NOT the target complexity.  
# 
############### DEFINITIONS ###############
#
# N = Sample Size
# f = The target function
# g = A hypothesis function for approximating a target function
# g^D = A hypothesis function for approximating a target function given a training set of size N, D
# E_D = Expectation with respect to all possible training sets of size N, D
# E_x = Expectation with respect to x
# E_in(g) = In-Sample Error
# E_out(g) = Out-of-Sample Error
# eps(x)^2 = Energy of stochastic noise
#
# g_bar(x) = the "average" hypothesis = E_D[g^D(x)]
#
# 1. E_out(g^D) = E_x[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2]
#
# 2. E_D[E_out(g^D)] = E_D[E_x[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2]] = E_x[E_D[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2]]
#
# 3. E_D[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2] = E_D[(g^D(x) - g_bar(X))^2] + (g_bar(x) - f(x))^2 = var(x) + bias(x)
#
# 4. Therefore, E_D[E_out(g^D)] = E_x[E_D[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2]] = E_x[bias(x) + var(x)] = bias + var
#
# *In the presence of stochastic noise; 
# E_(D,eps)[(g^D(x) - f(x))^2] = E_(D,x)[(g^D(x) - g_bar(X))^2] + E_x[(g_bar(x) - f(x))^2] + E_(eps,x)[eps(x)^2] 
#                              = var(x) + bias(x) + eps(x)^2
#                              = variance + bias + stochastic_noise
#
# bias = (g_bar(x) - f(x))^2
# var = E_D[(g^D(x) - g_bar(X))^2]
#
############### EXPERIMENT ###############
#
# This simulation uses various linear models to approximate a target function f:[-1, 1] -> R given by f(x) = sin(pi*x) 
# with a uniform input probability distribution on [-1, 1].  Each run generates a training set with only two 
# independently examples.  The selected learning algorithm then picks the hypothesis that minimizes the mean squared 
# error on the examples.  This is repeated for a specified number of trials after which g_bar, the average out of 
# sample error, e_out, model bias, and model variance are calculated and returned. 
#
# The model using a line through the origin, h(x) = ax, has the best combination of model bias and variance 
# among the models tested for approximating f(x) = sin(pi*x).  The model using a line with a variable intercept, 
# h(x) = ax + b, has the best model bias, however, this is offset by its relatively high model variance.  
# More complex quadratic models have progressively worse model bias and variance.  This is because such models are too 
# complex for the data resources provided (only two training examples).  
#
# If specified, the model's bias and variance is illustrated by constructing a plot depicting the target sinusoid 
# function, f(x), the selected model's expected hypothesis, g_bar(x), and every final hypothesis produced by the model 
# throughout the simulation.  It is possible to see the consequences of the high variance of exhibited by the 
# quadratic models by making repeated calls to the simulation.  Either of the quadratic models produces very different 
# expected hypotheses for each call; the smaller the number of trials used, the more amplified this effect becomes.  
# In contrast, the simpler models tend to produce relatively consistent expected hypotheses.
#
